====================================
The ``commondata`` namespace package
====================================

This package is the heart of "common data", a new and sustainable way
to maintain and share structured common knowledge.

The package itself contains just some utilities and defines the Python
``commondata`` namespace. It is the base for packages like 

- commondata.be : Common knowledge about Belgium
- commondata.ee : Common knowledge about Estonia

The ``commondata`` vision
=========================

Did you ever start to write your own list of the countries, the
capitals, the currencies or the languages of the world? Or the
chemical elements, the books of the Bible or the text of the Human
Rights declaration?

These things are considered common knowledge.  You can find them on
Wikipedia where they are freely available for everybody.

But did you ever try to import such a list and use it by your Python
program?  And did you ever work on a Wikipedia article which handles
this kind of data?

The ``commondata`` project suggests to store common knowledge as
Python source code and freely available under the GPL.

Maintained in Python
--------------------

The Python programming language brings together two qualities which 

- a syntax which makes it easy to use even for non-programmers
- a powerful programming language working behind the scenes


Freely available under the GPL
------------------------------

Free software should not depend on non-free material.
